## ⏱️ Epoch Time Conversion

As part of the data preprocessing, one of the key steps was **converting timestamp fields to epoch time format** to make them compatible with Tableau’s date and time functions.

This step helped in:
- Handling time-based filters and calculations.
- Creating year, month, and quarter-based insights from raw timestamp data.
